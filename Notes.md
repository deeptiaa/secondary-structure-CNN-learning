 # Notes:

## Domain

- Pab1 - domain is [(125, 200)]
- Bgl3 - no domain because PBD starts as same place as protein sequence (Boolean of PDB lines up with protein without change)
- Ube4b - domain is [(1071, 1173)], but position in Ube4b
- avGFP -
- GB1 -


## STRIDE

Documentation:

       H	    Alpha helix
	   G	    3-10 helix (variation of alpha helix)
	   I	    PI-helix
	   E	    Extended conformation (or strand - beta strands?)
	   B or	b   Isolated bridge (one hydrogen bond of the type found in a beta-sheet)
	   T	    Turn
	   C	    Coil (none of the above) (absence of regular secondary structure)


 - currently not including **C** or **T**

**CHECK OFFSET\****





Meeting Notes (July 12th, July 21st)
- ~~find the fraction of secondary structure for the proteins we have now (even distribution, if not look for more)~~, and fraction alpha/beta
- train on differing amounts of data and find protein in middle of distribution that has Pearson's R of ~0.4 (middle is Immunoglobulin, close to 55%)
- Scale training value and run other proteins (plot?)
- (Pearson's R on y, sec. str. fraction on x)
- train on alpha/beta subsets (equal alpha and beta fractions)
- maybe check that test size doesn't impact pearson's r?

Meeting Notes (July 12th)
- Keep the test set the same for the same protein in diff. architectures
- Find number of samples in and out of secondary structure and keep that ratio for the train and test sheet
- 3 trials
- Use remaining dataset for test datasets
- Use Ube4b to scale _test_ datasets
- change input layer to architecture


Tuesday/Wednesday - fix code in order to run and get datasets
Thursday/Friday - run code
Monday - extra and plots
